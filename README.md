Updated to: Minecraft Java Edition 19w38b

A [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) extension and NPM package providing JSON schemas for Minecraft: Java Edition datapack JSON files. Information about json schemas can be found at [json-schema.org](http://json-schema.org/).

# Design choices

-   The use of the `minecraft:` namespace is mandatory anywhere it can be used.
    This does mean that it will not necessarily validate against all vanilla
    files.

# Installation on VSCode (for Use)

0. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) if you haven't got it in your computer.
1. Download and install this extension on [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SPGoding.datapack-json).
    - Alternatives, you can search `SPGoding.datapack-json` in the sidebar and install it.
2. Open VSCode in your datapack folder (`.minecraft/saves/<world>/datapacks/<your datapack folder>`). You can do this by right-clicking the folder and select 'Open with Code'.

# Installation via NPM (for Projects)

You can install this package by executing `$ npm i datapack-json`.

## File Struture

- `src`: Stores all JSON Schemas.
    - `shared`: Stores all common JSON Schemas. Some of them are generated by `./scripts/convert.js` so you don't change them manually.
    - `tags`: Stores JSON Schemas for [tags](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tag).
    - `advancement.json`: JSON Schema for [advancements](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Advancements).
    - `loot_table.json`: JSON Schema for [loot tables](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Loot_table).
    - `pack.mcmeta.json`: JSON Schema for [`pack.mcmeta`](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_pack#pack.mcmeta).
    - `predicate.json`: JSON Schema for [`predicates`](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Predicate).
    - `recipe.json`: JSON Schema for [recipes](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Recipe).
- `scripts`: Stores useful tools.
    - `convert.js`: Convert `registries.json` generated by Minecraft data generator to `shared` files.
